# 1.6 String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
# of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the
# "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
# the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z). 

def stringCompression(string):
    compressed = []
    counter = 0

    for i in range(len(string)):
        if i != 0 and string[i] != string[i - 1]:
            compressed.append(string[i - 1] + str(counter))
            counter = 0
        counter += 1
    
    #special case for last character
    compressed.append(string[-1] + str(counter))

    #returns original string if compressed key isn't smaller
    return min(string, ''.join(compressed), key=len)
