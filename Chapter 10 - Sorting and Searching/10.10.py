# 10.1 o Rank from Stream: Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to be able
# to look up the rank of a numberx (the number of values less than or equal to x). lmplementthe data
# structures and algorithms to support these operations. That is, implement the method track ( int
# x), which is called when each number is generated, and the method getRankOfNumber(int
# x), which returns the number of values less than or equal to x (not including x itself).
